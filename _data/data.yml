  details: |
    After 22 years in the chemical manufacturing business the time has come to pursue my true passion. Transitioning to a new field of work at a later stage of life is not for the faint-hearted but this decision was made with the support of my family in an ideal moment. I lived through the personal computer golden age in the late 70s and early 80s and I got my first experience on an 8-bit Apple computer. I devoured any technical book I could lay my hands on to the point of writing and burning my own EPROMs to aid in my never-ending curiosity of that amazing machine. I reversed engineered enough software to understand the intricacies of the operating system and its entire 64KB memory map. That passion has never faded throughout my life and was always an integral part of my work in one way or another, if not in my home laboratory. I am eager to start at any position commensurate to my skills in order to:
    + Leverage my experience in administration and compiler design;
    + Be completely immersed in this industry to learn new things;
    + Share my domain knowledge and skills with others;
    + Grow professionally and gain financial stability;
    + Teach the next generation in any area required.

  intro: |
    These are the projects I am currently involved in:

  items:
    - name: 6502 BASIC Compiler
      link: https://github.com/ekbann/integer-basic
      details: |
        Designed and implemented a novel BASIC compiler to 65C02 assembly for the yet to be released Commander X16 computer. It is written in Python using the Lark parsing library. Based on Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC with additional routines to perform 32-bit fixed-point (Q16.16) math on a virtual stack machine. A Sieve of Eratosthenes benchmark indicates a 10x performance gain over interpreted BASIC. A future Mandelbrot benchmark will demonstrate its amazing fixed-point calculations performance compared to traditional floating-point implementations.

    - name: SPARC C Compiler
      link: https://github.com/ekbann/sparc-compiler
      details: |
        A comprehensive study on writing a C compiler for the SPARC sun4m architecture found in the SPARCstation 5 and SPARCstation 20. It is written in C using the GNU tools, Flex (lexical analyser) and Bison (parser generator). The compiler produces extremely tight assembly code and performs similarly to the GNU C Compiler output.

    - name: ARM BASIC Compiler
      link: 
      details: |
        A placeholder for a new project aimed at a full-featured BASIC compiler to ARM assembly for the Raspberry Pi computer. Focus will be placed primarily on the ARM11 processor and its ARMv6 instruction set architecture. The SoC is a Broadcom BCM2835 which contains an ARM1176JZFS, running at 700Mhz, with floating point VFPv2 and Videocore 4 GPU.

    - name: ApplePy
      link: https://github.com/ekbann/applepy
      details: |
        An Apple ][ emulator written in pure Python and Tkinter. It is not clock-cycle accurate but runs at approximately the same speed of a real Apple using PyPy3. Implements an accurate disk drive interface to process disk images using the 6+2 "nybble" encodings.
